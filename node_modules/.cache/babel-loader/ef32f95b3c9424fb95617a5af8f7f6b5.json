To share information and resources, LANs link together groups of computers and low-voltage devices over small distances (inside a building or between a group of two or three buildings near to one another). Enterprises typically manage and maintain LANs. To quickly and securely transfer data, LANs can link to wide area networks (WANs; detailed below) using routers. We will provide you best service of LANs and with the best support team so that if in future you face any problem then the team will instantly support you and solve your problem.\")))))), React.createElement(\"div\", {\n      className: \"row align-items-center mt-45\",\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 123\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, React.createElement(\"div\", {\n      className: \"col-12 mb-3\",\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 124\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, React.createElement(\"div\", {\n      className: \"services-details-play\",\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 125\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, React.createElement(\"img\", {\n      src: \"assets/images/services-play.jpg\",\n      alt: \"\",\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 126\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }))), React.createElement(\"div\", {\n      className: \"col-12 mb-3\",\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 130\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, React.createElement(\"div\", {\n      className: \"services-details-play-content\",\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 131\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, React.createElement(\"h4\", {\n      className: \"title\",\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 132\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, \"1.3 Common issues in Network Support Services:\"), React.createElement(\"p\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 133\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, \"Let's now go over some of the most typical network issues (or network mistakes) that have caused many users and network managers to yank their hair out! :\"), React.createElement(\"div\", {\n      className: \"points py-3\",\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 135\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, React.createElement(\"h5\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 136\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, \"1.3.1 IP Address Issues\"), React.createElement(\"ul\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 137\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, React.createElement(\"li\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 138\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, \"A computer can be identified by its IP address.

Similar to how an address for a house or apartment may specify the location of a building, this identifier indicates the location of your internet activity. The erroneous assignment of the same IP address to two computers is a frequent problem that occurs in workplace networks. As the two computers compete to come online, this causes evident connectivity problems ?</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <h5 className='mt-3'>Solution</h5>\r\n                    <p>Thankfully, the solution is straightforward.

In other words, a network could be challenging for users to connect to or might abruptly \"Boot\" users from the network without warning. To be able to operate effectively, everyone must be connected to the network, thus this kind of issue can be highly problematic. In general, physical concerns rather than technical ones can cause network connectivity problems ?</li>\r\n                      <li className='my-3 h4 list-style-none'>Solution</li>\r\n                      <li>Usually, a solution can be found by examining the physical connection and the condition of the connected equipment. Have any wires been unplugged, or are all of them plugged in? Is a wire being used defective? The troubleshooting solution is frequently discovered by looking at these connections. Your router or other devices should be placed with care. It's possible that your wireless device's signal is not as strong as you'd want in the office if you've placed it in a remote area of the building. It's best to place wireless devices in the middle of an office for optimal connectivity.</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <p className='my-3'>Network support services emphasize maintaining a company's business network.
