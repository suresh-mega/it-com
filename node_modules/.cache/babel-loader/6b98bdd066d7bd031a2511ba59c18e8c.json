QuickBooks</h3>\r\n                      <p>When it comes to accounting systems for small eCommerce enterprises, QuickBooks is by far the most popular option. Nevertheless, you need a dependable process for inputting your sales figures into QuickBooks to have correct accountancy. This is a must for accurate bookkeeping. Many accountants and business owners still enter data by hand, even though this method is labour-intensive, pricey, and prone to errors. Nevertheless, there are integration solutions made available by third parties that can automate entering data into QuickBooks. The features, cost, connections, and support offered by each of these solutions are distinct from one another. So, automating your data entry is the best way to maintain accounting records and prevent any possible errors that may arise during the accounting process.</p>\r\n                      <p>QuickBooks is the most common accounting software for small ecommerce businesses. However, in order to have accurate bookkeeping, you need a reliable system for entering your sales data into QuickBooks.</p>\r\n                      <p>Many accountants and business owners resort to hand-entering data, which is time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. However, there are 3rd party integration tools that automate data entry into QuickBooks. These tools differ in terms of functionality, pricing, integrations, and support.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>How do you choose which tool is the best fit for you? Here are the 10 most important factors to consider:</h5>\r\n                      <h6 className='mt-3'>Does the provider specialize in QuickBooks?</h6>\r\n                      <p>Some 3rd party integration tools sync ecommerce sales with multiple accounting systems such as QuickBooks , Xerox, and NetSuite. As all accounting systems require continuous updates, it is important that you choose a 3rd party integration tool that focuses specifically on QuickBooks.</p>\r\n                      <p>This will ensure that the tool keeps up with QuickBooks updates so that you can sync your sales data with QuickBooks seamlessly.</p>\r\n                      <p>It is also important to note that many providers sync only with QuickBooks Online. If you use QuickBooks Desktop or QuickBooks Hosting Service, be sure to inquire whether your provider supports it.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text py-3\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>Do you need to download a plugin?</h5>\r\n                      <p>For some data syncing solutions, you will need to install a plugin for your website. The disadvantage of this is that as QuickBooks and ecommerce platforms make updates, you will need to update your plugin as well.</p>\r\n                      <p>This is an additional time-commitment and can cause errors in your syncing. It is best to select a solution that does not require a plugin, so you don’t need to worry about any updates on your end.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text py-3\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>Is the data-syncing automatic or manual?</h5>\r\n                      <p>As an accountant or business owner, you already have many things to worry about. If the provider offers only manual sync, then you need to physically press a button each time that you want the data to be entered into QuickBooks. If you don’t sync on a regular basis, orders can accumulate, leading to syncing errors.</p>\r\n                      <p>The advantage of automatic sync is that orders will be synced continuously with QuickBooks on a regular basis. This will ensure that you always have the most up-to-date financial information in your QuickBooks account.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text py-3\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>What Kind Of Support Will You Have?</h5>\r\n                      <p>The purpose of a 3rd party integration tool is to simplify accounting for you. Ideally, the tool should enable you to “set it and forget it.” However, as both QuickBooks and ecommerce platforms make updates frequently, you will likely encounter some syncing errors.</p>\r\n                      <p>Be sure to inquire how you can get in touch with technical support if you do encounter syncing issues.</p>\r\n                      <p>Moreover, if it is important for you to have US-based support, inquire where the support team is located. In addition, find out whether your provider offers onboarding so you and your team can get trained on using the software.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text py-3\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>Is It A One-Way Or Two-Way Sync?</h5>\r\n                      <p>Most of the time, you will need to automate data entry from your selling channel to QuickBooks. If you sell on multiple channels or you take phone orders, a two-way sync between QuickBooks and your online selling channels can save you a lot of time.</p>\r\n                      <p>For example, if you sell on Amazon and Shopify, a two-way inventory sync can update the quantity on hand for both of your selling channels so that you don’t oversell. Or, if you take a phone order, a two-way sync can send the order from QuickBooks to a shipping solution such as Ship Station.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text py-3\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>Which Integrations Are Supported?</h5>\r\n                      <p>Be sure to inquire whether the platforms you use for ecommerce, shipping, and payment processing are supported.</p>\r\n                      <p>As every selling channel makes updates to their own platforms, you want to be sure that your provider continuously makes updates to their software as well. This way, you minimize the chances of errors when syncing your ecommerce platforms with your QuickBooks accounts.</p>\r\n                      <p>If you sell on multiple channels, be sure to inquire whether the provider can automate data syncing from multiple platforms.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text py-3\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>What Is Their Pricing Structure?</h5>\r\n                      <p>It is very important to inquire about the pricing structure before you start your free trial. Some providers base their pricing on the number of integrations, users, or order volume.
