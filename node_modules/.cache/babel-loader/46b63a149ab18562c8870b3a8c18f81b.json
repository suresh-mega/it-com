In addition, reconciliation ensures that the accounts in the general ledger are correct, consistent, and comprehensive.

The records can be reconciled regularly, monthly, or yearly, depending on your preference.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text py-3\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>The Initial Procedure</h5>\r\n                      <p>Before you proceed to reconcile your accounts, you need your account statement or the accounts which you are going to reconcile.

The online version of QuickBooks offers many different possibilities, such as adding, matching, and transferring. When a spending or deposit is matched, it indicates a similar bill or purchase receipt that goes along with it. The addition function is used when it is necessary to classify an expense. When you categorise something, you select the category to which the item most closely relates. This could be an expense or an income. In many instances, QuickBooks Online will choose a category independently, and you may create rules that will allocate transactions with comparable characteristics within the same category.</p>\r\n                      <p>Navigate to the Banking button left of the Quick Books Online page. Make selections under \"Banking\" on the dropdown menu. You can access the aforementioned choices by looking to the far right of the screen.</p>\r\n                      <p>Proceed with the right course of action after going through each transaction.
