Let's see how you can sort and manage your AOL Mail 295 inbox.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text py-3\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>How to Sort and remove your emails in AOL Mail 295?</h5>\r\n                      <p>There might be hundreds or even thousands of emails in your inbox, and sorting or deleting them might take some time. To get started, follow the below steps to delete your emails in your AOL Mail 295 inbox.</p>\r\n                      <div className='points-number'>\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                          <li>Open the inbox or folder that contains your email.</li>\r\n                          <li>Select one by one the emails you want to delete by checking the square box next to your emails.</li>\r\n                          <li>Click on the trash or delete button on the top right of your screen.</li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <p>If you don't want to select the emails one by one, you can also choose your emails all at once by clicking Ctrl + A, which will select all your mail in your AOL Mail 295 inbox, and then delete them by clicking on the delete button.</p>\r\n                      <p>You can sort your emails by clicking the sorting button and selecting the criteria you want to sort by, like date, time etc. Sorting and deleting your AOL Mail 295 inbox is an excellent way of getting rid of unnecessary emails and increasing your productivity results.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text py-3\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>Organising your AOL Mail 295</h5>\r\n                      <p>There might be some emails you might not want to delete or are unsure what to do with them. In that case, you can put them in a folder and make your inbox cleaner and more organised. You can create folders by clicking on the folders option in the left sidebar and creating them by any name you want, like family, work, trip, friends, etc.</p>\r\n                      <p>Downloading attachments, which is mostly what this step is for, is how you clear off storage in your AOL inbox. When you save attachments, you ensure that you still have access to them even if something happens to your <Link to=\"/blog/aol-mail-295-download\">AOL Mail 295 downlaod</Link> account. On the other hand, it's not just the attachments that may be saved offline; emails can also be saved.</p>\r\n                      <p>Using Personal Filling Cabinet, a feature provided by AOL Mail 295, you can access your emails, attachments and other files, even when you are not connected to the internet. To save your emails locally, you can follow these steps.</p>\r\n                      <div className='points-number'>\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                          <li>Open your AOL Mail 295 inbox or the folder that contains the email you want to download.</li>\r\n                          <li>Select the emails by simply clicking on them or pressing Ctrl + A or Ctrl + Shift key + your emails.</li>\r\n                          <li>After selecting your emails, click on the save icon and select the destination on your PC.</li>\r\n                          <li>You can also individually save your emails on your computer by clicking the email, then clicking on the file, Save as and saving them on your PC.</li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text py-3\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>Preventing Unnecessary Emails by Unsubscribing</h5>\r\n                      <p>If you have been using the internet for more than a day, there is a good possibility that you have subscribed to at least a couple of mailing lists that you do not now require or that you were never truly interested in joining in the first place. It is highly recommended that you unsubscribe from them to prevent your inbox from becoming cluttered with junk mail in the future.</p>\r\n                      <p>Filtering your AOL Mail 295 emails can be helpful in this situation because there are likely to be a lot of emails that aren't truly urgent but also aren't junk. As was discussed before, this can be accomplished manually by using folders.</p>\r\n                      <p>The \"Other\" inbox is where Priority Inbox directs everything else, including mailing lists and e-receipts, while the \"Priority Inbox\" inbox contains only the most urgent of your incoming messages. This keeps your inbox clear, allowing you to focus on the e-mails that are most important to you while dealing with the rest of them at your own pace.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-text py-3\">\r\n                      <h5 className='title'>Conclusion</h5>\r\n                      <p>Productivity is the most important thing when you want to remain focused and achieve great results. However, when it comes to email, it becomes troublesome when you have to deal with hundreds and hundreds of emails every day. It can take a lot of time to go through your email, thus halting your productivity. To increase your productivity, it becomes necessary to maintain and organize your AOL Mail 295 inbox. If you follow the above tips, you are guaranteed greater productivity with your AOL Mail 295.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-tags d-block d-sm-flex align-items-center justify-content-between\">\r\n                      <div className=\"tag-item\">\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                          <li><span>TAGS  :</span></li>\r\n                          <li><a href=\"#\">Photography,</a></li>\r\n                          <li><a href=\"#\">Content,</a></li>\r\n                          <li><a href=\"#\">News</a></li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div className=\"social-item\">\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                          <li><a href=\"#\"><i className=\"fa fa-facebook-f\" /></a></li>\r\n                          <li><a href=\"#\"><i className=\"fa fa-twitter\" /></a></li>\r\n                          <li><a href=\"#\"><i className=\"fa fa-google\" /></a></li>\r\n                          <li><a href=\"#\"><i className=\"fa fa-linkedin\" /></a></li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"blog-details-manager text-center\">\r\n                      <img src=\"https://q9k2n7g7.stackpathcdn.com/blog-manager.png\" alt=\"\" />\r\n                      <h4 className=\"title\">Edward murphy</h4>\r\n                      <span>HD Manager</span>\r\n                      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
